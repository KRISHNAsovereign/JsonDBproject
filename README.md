# JsonDBproject
This project is a simple web-based form to manage employee details using Bootstrap for UI components and JsonPowerDB for database management. The form collects Employee ID, Employee Name, and Employee Email, validates the inputs, and stores the data in JsonPowerDB using a PUT request.
